# ✨ Nice to meet you, I'm Isabella! ✨
Let's get to know each other. Here's a little about me:
👩‍💻 My pronouns are she/her
🍁 I'm based in Canada!
📚 I'm an undergrad CS Student
🖥 I'm an aspiring Full Stack Developer, with a slight bias for Front-end and a curiosity 🧐 for Web Design 
💡 I'm currently working on school, a client website, a little side project to improve my React skills, and an attempt at a web design portfolio
😄 Outside of CS, you can find me advocating for Dark Mode on everything (thank you for finally listening, Github!), doing free courses I find on the Internet, playing video games (mostly life simulation--they're not so intense but very addicting), or trying to beat my record of naming 170 countries in 15 minutes from memory

👋 Oh, and I also love connecting with new people 🤗 Feel free to reach out:
