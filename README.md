# ✨ Nice to meet you, I'm Isabella! ✨
👩‍💻 She/Her<br>
🍁 Based in Canada!<br>
📚 Undergrad CS Student<br>
🖥 Aspiring Full Stack Developer, with a slight bias for Front-end and a curiosity 🧐 for Web Design <br>
💡 Currently working on school, a client website, a little side project to improve my React skills, and an attempt at a web design portfolio
<p>Outside of CS, you can find me advocating for Dark Mode on everything (thank you for finally listening, Github!), doing free courses I find on the Internet, playing video games (mostly life simulation--they're not so intense but very addicting), or trying to beat my record of naming 170 countries in 15 minutes from memory.</p>

<p>👋 Oh, and I also love connecting with new people! Whether you want to talk about tech, life, philosophy, or whatever, feel free to reach out!</p>
